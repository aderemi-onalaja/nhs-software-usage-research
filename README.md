# NHS vs Private Healthcare Software Usage Research

This repository documents a case study project by **Aderemi Onalaja**.  
The research explores how software is currently used across NHS departments compared to private healthcare, with a focus on:

- Tools in use
- Frequency of usage
- Pain points & inefficiencies
- Costs (licensing, maintenance, training)
- Onboarding processes
- Integrations with other systems
- Impact on everyday operations

## 🔍 Alternative Tools Matrix
A sample matrix comparing NHS and private healthcare software:

| Tool        | Cost (£) | Onboarding Time | Features (1–5) | Integrations (1–5) | Usability (1–5) | Notes |
|-------------|----------|-----------------|----------------|---------------------|-----------------|-------|
| **Epic**    | High (£££) | 3–6 months       | 5              | 5                   | 3               | Widely used in NHS trusts, highly integrated but expensive and complex to learn. |
| **Cerner**  | High (£££) | 3–6 months       | 4              | 4                   | 3               | Strong EHR platform, big presence in NHS and US private sector. |
| **EMIS**    | Medium (££) | 1–3 months       | 3              | 3                   | 4               | Common in GP practices across the NHS. |
| **Athenahealth** | Medium (££) | 1–2 months | 4              | 4                   | 5               | Cloud-based, widely used in private US sector. |
