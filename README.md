- Tools in use
- Frequency of usage
- Pain points & inefficiencies
- Costs (licensing, maintenance, training)
- Onboarding processes
- Integrations with other systems
- Impact on everyday operations

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
This project demonstrates:  
- Designing a methodology to assess NHS software usage across trusts and departments.  
- Collecting and analysing survey data from multiple roles (nurses, doctors, admin, managers).  
- Categorising tools by function (EHR, scheduling, admin, analytics, communication).  
- Understanding why software stacks vary across NHS trusts (procurement, legacy systems, budgets, training gaps).  
- Identifying opportunities to reduce duplication and streamline software usage.  
- Highlighting areas where AI solutions could be deployed to improve efficiency and outcomes.  
- Providing a contextual comparison with private healthcare to benchmark NHS adoption.
